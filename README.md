## GDucpm TTYbatd - A package designed for monitoring battery on Arch Linux TTYs  

### Basic info  
**Current maintainer**: GDucpm  
**Original creator**: GDucpm  
**License**: GPL v3  

### What this is  
It's a basic battery monitor that yells at you when you have 15% left, then yells at you again when you have 7% left with a dramatic 20-second-countdown-till-suspension twist.

### Why am I making this  
Because I feel the people who realize they like using pure TTY on arch but it doesn't have a vanilla battery monitor and they won't know when systemd will slap the shutdown screen on their face.  

### Thx for viewing my package  
I'm an ultimate noob in these thigns and I really wanted to make pkgs that are actually useful to the community. So with all my effort, here it is.
